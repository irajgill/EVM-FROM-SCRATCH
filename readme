# EVM-FROM-SCRATCH

EVM-FROM-SCRATCH is an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in Go. It follows the Ethereum Yellow Paper, with clear, idiomatic Go code for accessibility and extensibility.

## Features

- **Core EVM Interpreter:** Executes EVM bytecode, modeling stack, memory, storage, and flow control as per Ethereum specification.
- **Educational Structure:** Minimal dependencies, focused on readability and hackability.
- **Testing & Linting Automation:** Full developer tooling for Go best practices and continuous integration.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Tools: `golangci-lint`, `shadow` (for full linting support)

### Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/irajgill/EVM-FROM-SCRATCH.git`

`cd EVM-FROM-SCRATCH`

`go mod tidy`


## Usage

The main EVM implementation is in the `go-evm/evm` directory. You can import this as a package or run the included test suite to explore its behavior. Modify or extend the code for your use case or to better understand EVM semantics.

## Developer Workflow

All common tasks are automated via Makefile targets.

### Common Commands

- **Help:** `make help`
- **Lint and Format:** `make lint`
   
Runs `go mod tidy`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, and variable shadow checks.


Automatically formats the code using `make fmt`.

- **Testing:** `make test`

- Runs all EVM package tests with coverage reporting: `make coverage`
